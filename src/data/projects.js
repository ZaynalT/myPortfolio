I began by working on in-house IoT projects available within the company, gaining hands-on experience. As I progressed, I shifted my focus to refining my expertise in React, recognizing its dominance in the market. My goal was to build a strong portfolio by creating and showcasing projects on GitHub.\n\nIn early 2024, I received devastating newsâ€”my mother had been diagnosed with cancer. Unfortunately, no viable treatment options were available for her in Sweden, and the proposed alternatives offered little hope. As a family, we made the difficult decision to seek medical care in Turkey, where she underwent extensive surgery and treatment. My brother and I traveled with her, staying from May 2024 to January 2025 to provide support during this critical period."
